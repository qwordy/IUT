# Design of Iteration 1 
Iteration 1 (D1 ~ D3):

Java IUT workflow simplification
## 1. Code comprehension

Read and comprehend the source code of IUT Java version, and see how the system is implemented and if any optimization is possible.

Go through other files concerning the project, including shell scripts and sql files, to gain a better understanding of its design and implementation.

## 2. Simplify the original workflow

Revise the original workflow to a more simplified one, with the basic goal of process IUT between two folders.

## 3. Optimization

Make optimizations like 

- enable IUT to work with two certain commits based on the version control system
- improve the efficiency and lower the overhead
- add version info into database(as was mentioned in the last meeting)
